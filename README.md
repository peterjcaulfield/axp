# raiden
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/peterjcaulfield/raiden.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/peterjcaulfield/raiden)

`raiden` is CLI dev tool for interacting with web API's. With some simple user defined configs, `raiden` will allow you to
execute requests against API's without the overhead of jumping into a browser or fiddling with `curl`.  

# Why

`raiden` can drastically speed up your workflow with features like:

- Tabbed autocompletion of request names/enviroments makes any interaction with `raiden` convenient and fast. 
- Dynamic request payloads from static configs. No more manual changing of the request payload between requests.
- Cookie Jar out of the box. Cookies are persisted and used in subsequent requests.
- Requests are very easy to define. `raiden` all does the heavy lifting.

---

# Installation

`npm install -g raiden`

To enable tab-completion for bash, add the following to your `.bashrc` script:

`which raiden > /dev/null && . "$( raiden initpath )"`

---

# Getting started

First create a hidden `.raiden` folder in your home directory. You then need to create two config files, one for 
the API hostnames and one for the individual API request definitions.

Hostnames are stored `~/.raiden/envs.yml` as key/value. You can also define a `default` host to be used for when 
no host is provided to `raiden`. An example config looks like so:

```
# ~/.raiden/envs.yml

default: 127.0.0.1:8888
dev_api: dev_api.localhost.com:8888

```

API request definitions are stored in ~/.raiden/requests.yml`. An simple example config with one request defined looks like so:

```
# ~/.raiden/requests.yml

get_posts:
    endpoint: posts

```

Using the above two example configs, we could then execute an API request with:
```
raiden request -e dev_api get_posts`
```

This would issue a `GET` request to `http://dev_api.localhost.com/posts`

`raiden` supports most of [node request library](https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/README.md) API which
it is built on top of by way of request-promise.

## Custom headers

```
# ~/.raiden/requests.yml

get_posts:
    endpoint: posts
    method: GET
    headers: 
        User-Agent: raiden
    qs:             
        rpp: 10
        page: 2

```

With this config `raiden get_posts` would execute a `GET` request to default host e.g:

`http://127.0.0.1:8888/posts/?rrp=10&page=2`

---

## Forms

`raiden` supports `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data` form uploads.

### application/x-www-form-urlencoded (URL-Encoded forms)

```
# ~/.raiden/requests.yml

url_encoded_form_request:
    endpoint: form
    method: POST
    form:
        foo: bar
        baz: qux
```

### multipart/form-data (Multipart form uploads)

```
# ~/.raiden/requests.yml

multipart_form_request:
    endpoint: upload
    method: POST
    formData:
        my_field: value 
        file_1: test.txt # this path will be read relative to the .raiden directory
        file_2: /absolute/path/to/img.png # you can also provide absolute paths
```
If you provide a file path as a value, `raiden` will take care of grabbing binary data needed for the request.
Any other values will be left unchanged.

---

## Json

Defining a POST request with a json payload is simple:

```
# ~/.raiden/requests.yml

json_request:
    endpoint: posts
    method: POST
    body:
        title: my post
        author: Ernest Hemingway
        text: this is some post text
    json: true # let raiden know we want to POST as json
```

---
## TLS/SSL Protocol

A request that utilises a self signed SSL cert:

```
# ~/.raiden/requests.yml

login:
    protocol: https
    endpoint: login
    agentOptions:
        ca: /path/to/ca.cert.pem
```
Check out the [node request library](https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/README.md) for more information on
configuration possible with the `agentOptions` object.

---
## Dynamic request payloads
`raiden` allows you to generate dynamic payload data from your static request config using the `transforms` key.

It achieves this by integrating with the fantastic [chance library](https://github.com/chancejs/chancejs) to generate the data. 
A good use case example for a transform would be if you wanted to interact with a user registration API endpoint and it required 
a unique username in the payload of every request. Rather than manually altering the payload everytime you execute the request, 
you can use a transform like so:

```
# ~/.raiden/requests.yml

register:
    method: POST
    endpoint: register
    body:
        username: placeholder # raiden will replace this value with a generated value using transform defined below
        password: password
    json: true
    transforms:
        - transform: [string, { prefix: hans_gruber_, length: 10 }]
          key: username
```

The above transform would change the Json POST body of the register request to something like:

```
{
    username: hans_gruber_hkJ983jFn5
    password: password
}
```

`raiden` transforms can also handle generating dynamic values for nested payload props. We just need to specify the path to the prop
using the pipe `|` seperator to delineate the nested object keys. Ex:

```
# ~/.raiden/requests.yml

register:
    method: POST
    endpoint: register
    body:
        data:
            username: placeholder # raiden will replace this value with a generated value using transform defined below
            password: password
    json: true
    transforms:
        - transform: [string, { prefix: hans_gruber_, length: 10 }]
          key: data|username 
```
The API of the `transforms` request property is detailed in the API section.
